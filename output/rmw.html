This plugin also lets you change how many pixels the characters move per step, letting you set up a 24x24 movement or a 1x1 (pixel movement) Note there are a few mv features disabled/broken; mouse movement, followers, and vehicles.<br><br>

This plugin has built-in compatibilty for QMovement. When using QMovement the line of sight will be more accurate since it'll use a shadow casting algorithm. When not using QMovement it'll use a simple ray casting.<br><br>

This plugin is used to help ease development of configurations by letting you import from different sources. If you have a note tag that is going to be used in multiple game objects, you can configure just one of them and have the rest import the notes from that "master" object. Then whenever you edit the "master" all the ones that are importing from it will also get the change.<br><br>

This is an addon to QMovement plugin. This addon adds a feature that lets you add colliders to regions. In QuasiMovement this was known as RegionBoxes. Region Colliders take priority over tiles. So if there's a region over a tile, it will use the region collider instead of that tiles collider. With this you can make certain impassable tiles passable by adding a passable region collider ontop of it.<br><br>

This adds support for followers when using QMovement. *Note:* I won't be continuing working on this plugin. I personally dislike followers and rather not do anything with them. So if you have issues with this plugin you will need to try to fix it your self or find another plugin dev to fix it for you. Sorry!<br><br>
