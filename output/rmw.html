This plugin lets you add real time line of sight to characters. A line of sight is similar to a sensor plugin, except characters can't see behind objects that block their view. This plugin has built-in compatibilty for QMovement. When using QMovement the line of sight will be more accurate since it'll use a shadow casting algorithm. When not using QMovement it'll use a simple ray casting.<br><br>

This is an addon to QMovement plugin. This addon adds a feature that lets you add colliders to regions. In QuasiMovement this was known as RegionBoxes. Region Colliders take priority over tiles. So if there's a region over a tile, it will use the region collider instead of that tiles collider. With this you can make certain impassable tiles passable by adding a passable region collider ontop of it.<br><br>
